# Releases this package to PyPI. Run from the repository root, with the .venv
# from the README:
#
#   make release-test   rehearse on TestPyPI
#   make release        publish to PyPI; needs a clean git tree
#   make smoke          install the published version in a fresh venv
#   make dist           build and check without uploading (optional)
#
# Both uploads run `make dist` first, which runs the full check (nox), then
# builds and checks the files; nothing is uploaded if any step fails.
#
# Twine asks for the API token unless TWINE_PASSWORD is set; a TestPyPI token
# is separate from a PyPI one.
