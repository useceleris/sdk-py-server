# Releases this package to PyPI. Run from the repository root:
#
#   make release-test   rehearse on TestPyPI
#   make release        publish to PyPI; needs a clean git tree
#   make smoke          install the published version in a fresh environment
#   make dist           check and build without uploading (optional)
#
# Both uploads run `make dist` first, which runs the full check (nox) against
# the committed uv.lock, then builds; nothing is uploaded if any step fails.
#
# Unless UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN is set, uv asks for a username, then a password:
# enter __token__, then the API token. A TestPyPI token is separate from a
# PyPI one.
